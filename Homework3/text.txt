It was one of Nissan's first crossovers and was released about the same time as several other companies' competing car based crossovers, including the Ford Escape and its Mazda Tribute sibling, the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson and its modern sibling, Kia Sportage as well as the compact body on frame Suzuki Grand Vitara before third generation.

The X-Trail is positioned below the truck based Xterra and Pathfinder, and was never offered by dealerships in the United States. The first generation was available in Canada until it was replaced by the Rogue, however, both the Rogue and the X-Trail are sold in Mexico.

The Rogue shares the same platform as the second generation X-Trail, and is very similar to the Qashqai. The X-Trail's All-Mode 4x4 transmission transfer case enables the driver to select between 2WD, 4WD or 4WD Lock through an electronic switch on the dashboard.

The company currently offers a hydrogen fuel cell model named the X-Trail FCV on lease to businesses. The main production plant of the X-Trail is in Kanda, Fukuoka, Kyushu, Japan; though parts and engines that are produced in Japan are also assembled by other Nissan plants in numerous countries.
